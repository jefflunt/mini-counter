- Allow some kind of get status, with a date range, to dump metrics + aggregates
  out of the system
- Config file for controlling behavior
- Need an event log, so that we can do aggregates across time intervals
- Allow de-duplication over a range (i.e. only count at most once in a hour,
  day, week, etc.)
- Listen for counting events from:
  - UDP
  - TDP
- Output counting events to:
  - file
  - database
- Upon count:
  - add to metrics and update aggregates
